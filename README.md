# iType-mvc | Platform for learning touch typing in Spring MVC

Took my first year team project iType and rewrote it following the Spring MVC architecture.

The best typing skills come with touch-typing, or the ability to type without looking at the keyboard.

Not only does it increase typing speed, but it helps you stay focused on the task at hand and the content you are producing, instead of the disruption caused by visually searching for keys.
